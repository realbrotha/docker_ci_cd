!  app-defaults RESOURCE SPECIFICATIONS FOR Mwm
!		(mwm has precedence over Mwm)
!

!!
!! NOTE: In Mwm 1.1.1 and newer, the resources 'buttonBindings' and
!!	 'keyBindings' should not be defined in the Mwm app-defaults file.
!!	 The defaults are set internally in Mwm to 'DefaultButtonBindings' and
!!	 'DefaultKeyBindings' respectively.
!!
!!	 Users and system admin need only define the default button and key
!!	 bindings in the appropriate mwm config file (ie. .mwmrc or
!!	 system.mwmrc).
!!
!!	 The 'windowMenu' resource defaults to 'DefaultWindowMenu', and
!!	 in Mwm 1.2 there is a default root menu that is defined as
!!	 'DefaultRootMenu'.
!!

!Mwm*moveThreshold:		3

!!	 If the 'moveOpaque' resource is set to True, window contents
!!	 will remain visible during window placement. This will generate
!!	 a lot of extra demand for the X-server, so it is not recommended
!!	 for use with X-stations (or any other remote X-server situations).

!Mwm*moveOpaque:		True

!
! component appearance resources 
!

!!
!! NOTE: In Mwm 1.2, the resources 'resizeBorderWidth' and 'frameBorderWidth'
!!	 are calculated dynamically depending on the size and resolution of
!!	 the screen.  In general, you should not have to set these resources
!!	 in the Mwm app-defaults file.
!!

! FONT stuff
! Mwm*fontList:			variable
! Use ISO compliant font
Mwm*fontList:			-dt-interface system-medium-r-normal-L*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*:
! Use smaller fixed font for icons
! Mwm*icon*fontList:		fixed

!! Client decorations for common clients - SAMPLES
!Mwm*XClock*clientDecoration:		border
!Mwm*XLoad*clientDecoration:		border
!Mwm*XBiff*clientDecoration:		border
