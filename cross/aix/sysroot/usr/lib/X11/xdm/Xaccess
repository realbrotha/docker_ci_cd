# Access control file for XDMCP connections
#
# To control Direct and Broadcast access:
#
#	pattern
#
# To control Indirect queries:
#
# 	pattern		list of hostnames and/or macros ...
#
# To use the chooser:
#
#	pattern		CHOOSER BROADCAST
#
# or
#
#	pattern		CHOOSER list of hostnames and/or macros ...
#
# To define macros:
#
#       %name		list of hosts ...
#
# The first form tells xdm which displays to respond to itself.
# The second form tells xdm to forward indirect queries from hosts matching
# the specified pattern to the indicated list of hosts.
# The third form tells xdm to handle indirect queries using the chooser;
# the chooser is directed to send its own queries out via the broadcast
# address and display the results on the terminal.
# The fourth form is similar to the third, except instead of using the
# broadcast address, it sends DirectQuerys to each of the hosts in the list
#
# In all cases, xdm uses the first entry which matches the terminal;
# for IndirectQuery messages only entries with right hand sides can
# match, for Direct and Broadcast Query messages, only entries without
# right hand sides can match.
#

*					#any host can get a login window

#
# To hardwire a specific terminal to a specific host, you can
# leave the terminal sending indirect queries to this host, and
# use an entry of the form:
#

#terminal-a	host-a


#
# The nicest way to run the chooser is to just ask it to broadcast
# requests to the network - that way new hosts show up automatically.
# Sometimes, however, the chooser can't figure out how to broadcast,
# so this may not work in all environments.
#

*		CHOOSER BROADCAST	#any indirect host can get a chooser

#
# If you'd prefer to configure the set of hosts each terminal sees,
# then just uncomment these lines (and comment the CHOOSER line above)
# and edit the %hostlist line as appropriate
#

#%hostlist	host-a host-b

#*		CHOOSER %hostlist 	#
