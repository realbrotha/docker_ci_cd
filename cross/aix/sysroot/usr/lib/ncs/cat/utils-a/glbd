glbd - Global Location Broker Subsystem

The global location broker (GLB) subsystem (glbd) helps clients to locate
servers on a network or internet. The GLB database stores the locations
(that is, the network addresses and port numbers) where server subsystems
are running. A process maintains this database and provides access to it.

You can replicate the GLB database to increase its availability. Copies of
the database can exist on several hosts, with glbd running on each of those
hosts to maintain the consistency of the database replicas. (In an internet,
at least one glbd must run in each network.) Each replica of the GLB keeps a
list of all the other GLB replicas. The GLBDs Replicas Administration
(drm_admin) tool administers the replication of the GLB database and of the
replica list.

The glbd command writes diagnostic output to the file /etc/ncs/glb_log.

Syntax

startsrc -s glbd [ -a " [ -create { -first [ -family family_name ]
| -from host_name } ] [ -debug ] [ -log_stdout ] " ]

Parameters

-create
     Creates a replica of the GLB. This option creates a GLB database in
     addition to starting a broker subsystem. It must be used with either
     -first or -from.

-first
     Use this option only with -create. Use it to create the first replica
     (that is, the very first instance) of the GLB on the network or
     internet.

-family family_name
     Use this option only with -first, to specify the address family that
     the first replica will use to identify itself on the replica list. Any
     subsequently created replicas must use this family to communicate with
     this replica. The family_name can only be ip.

-from host_name
     Use this option only with -create, to create additional replicas of the
     global location broker. A replica of the global location broker must
     exist at host_name. The database and replica list for the new replica
     are initialized from those at host_name. The replica at host_name adds
     an entry for the new replica to its replica list and propagates the
     entry to the other global location broker replicas. A host_name takes
     the form family:host, where the host can be specified either by its
     name or by its network address.

     The following are examples of acceptable host names:

     ip:bertie

     ip:#192.5.5.5

     The new replica uses the same address family as host_name in
     identifying itself on the replica list. For example, if host_name is an
     IP address, the new replica is listed by its IP address on the replica
     list.

-debug
     Prints debugging information.

-log_stdout
     Redirects the log and debug printout to standard output instead of
     /etc/ncs/glb_log.

Examples

Create and start for the first time the first replica of the GLB on
the network or internet:

startsrc -s  glbd -a "-create -first -family ip"

Start for the first time a subsequent replica of the GLB, initializing its
database from host buddy:

startsrc -s  glbd -a "-create -from ip:buddy"

Restart an existing replica of the GLB:

startsrc -s  glbd
