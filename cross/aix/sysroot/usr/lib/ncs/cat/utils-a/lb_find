lb_find - GLBs List

The GLBs List (lb_find) lists global location broker processes and their
attributes. It sends out inquiries to the NCS location broker processes and
gathers the responses.

If on the workstation where you issue the command there are not the two 
files:

glb_site.txt
glb_obj.txt

lb_find finds all the GLB processes of the same subnet, or all the GLB
processes it can reach via broadcast.

If you want to see GLB processes of a different subnetwork you must have
those two files. In such a case lb_find finds all the GLB processes that
run on the hosts whose addresses are in the glb_site.txt, situated in the
cell specified in the glb_obj.txt. If the glb_obj.txt is not on the
workstation, the default cell is taken.

The results are analyzed to determine whether or not the global location
broker can be replicated, and which cell each daemon serves. After 10
seconds, the results are summarized, showing the server host's network
address, the port number, the global location broker type, a cell name of
either default or alternate_n, where n is a number greater than or equal to
1, and the cell's UUID.

Syntax

lb_find [ -dl ] [ -f ip | -q ] [ -h ] [ -v ]

Parameters

-dl
     Turn on RPC remote procedure call (RPC) debugging while searching for
     GLB servers.

-f
     Query for the global location broker servers that communicate with the
     specified protocol in all the cells.

-q
     Query for a global location broker server using the standard RPC
     mechanism. At most, one global location broker server is printed, and
     only servers in the current machine's cell are searched. The program
     exits with a status of 0 if a global location broker server is found;
     otherwise, the status is nonzero.

-h
     Print out the help for the command.

-v
     Print out the NCS version string.

Example

A network contains two global location broker processes (glbd) in the
default NCS cell.

lb_find

This is the output:

       sent to broadcast address ip:#9.87.220.255
       waiting for replies
       ip:server5(9.87.220.5) 1024 replicatable default
       333b91c50000.0d.00.00.87.84.00.00.00
       ip:server3(9.87.220.3) 1072 replicatable default
       333b91c50000.0d.00.00.87.84.00.00.00
