llbd - Local Location Broker Subsystem

The local location broker subsystem (llbd) is part of the network computing
system (NCS). It manages the local location broker (LLB) database, which
stores information about NCS based server programs running on the local
host.

A host must run llbd if it is to support the location broker forwarding
function or to allow remote access, for example by the Local Broker
Administration (lb_admin) to the LLB database. In general, any host that
runs NCS-based servers should run an llbd, and llbd should be running before
any such servers are started. Additionally, any network or internet
supporting NCS activity should have at least one host running a global
location broker subsystem (glbd).

Syntax

startsrc -s llbd [ -a " -dl " ]

Parameters

-dl
