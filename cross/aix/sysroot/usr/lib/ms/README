This directory contains various macro files used by the -ms package,
along with a script that may be useful for text formatting.  This
script is not a supported command -- it is an example to assist you
with document preparation. The script, endnote, is described below.

endnote
-------
This program takes -ms footnotes (text placed between .FS and .FE
macros) and moves them to the end of your output.  It should be
used with numbered footnotes, which are entered like this:

	this is best explained by Hodgkins.\**
	.FS
	Arthur Hodgkins, \fIThe Bone Marrow,\fP
	Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore, 1982.
	.FE

When you want to produce numbered endnotes instead of footnotes,
you can run the program as follows:

	 sh /usr/lib/ms/endnote filename(s) | nroff -ms

Other nroff options, such as -T to specify terminal type, may
also be given.  If you're using refer, tbl, or eqn, they should
follow /usr/lib/ms/endnote, in the proper order.  The endnote
script creates the file "endnotes" in the working directory;
the file is removed after endnote finishes.  If this file
already exists, the program exits with an error message.

You may find it more convenient to copy this script to a directory
on your search path, rather than saying "sh /usr/lib/ms/endnote" every
time you want to run it.  For example, assuming the directory /mydir is
already on the search path, type:

	cp /usr/lib/ms/endnote /mydir/endnote
	chmod +x /mydir/endnote

The first command will copy endnote into /mydir, and the second will 
make it executable.
