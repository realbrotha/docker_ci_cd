# This file can be used to customize the behavior of the ct_UCS and
# UCS_ct conversions.   Each line may be of the form:
#	<Charset>   <Escape_seq_string>
# 
# The Escape_sequence_string is optional if it is a well known 
# registered escape sequence.
#
# The order of Charset  determines which escape sequence will be used
# for any UCS code point that can be mapped to multiple ISO 2022
# escape sequences, i.e. specifically for CJK characters.
