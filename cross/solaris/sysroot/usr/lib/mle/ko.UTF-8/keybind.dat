# Conversion mode and keybinding definition file
#
# In this file the text after a pound sign (#) until end of line is a comment.
# A set of definitions for a conversion manager (CM) starts with
# tow percentage signs (%%) and ends with either two percentage signs
# which indidate the start of another CM definitions or End-of-File.
# For each CM a number of input modes can be specified after a
# percentage signs (%).
# This set of definition is described as follows:
#
# %%<cm library identification words>	
#	%<input mode>:<key names>:<function key name>:<message displayed>
#		<special key name>{=<key names>}{=<function key>}
#
# A CM reads <cm library identification words> to match its identification
# words.  When such <cm library identification words> are found, the CM
# read the keybinding and mode information till two percentage signs or EOF.
#
# <Input mode> is read by a CM.  A CM can be turned into this mode by a user
# with either the key(s) <key names> or the function key <function key name>.
# When the CM is in a certain mode the corresponding <message displayed> is
# displayed in the mode region.  (ref to <mle/cm.h> and <mle/env.h>)
# The set of <special key names> defines the special keys the CM supports
# during the input conversion.  A user can bind one or more key names 
# or function keys to a <special key name>
# Some examples of <special key names> are listed as follows:
#		CM_ON			Conversion on
#		CM_OFF			Conversion off
#		CV			Convert and display focus area
#		NC			Display the next choice
#		PC			Display the previous choice
#		CM			Commit the intermediate region
#		FR			Move focus area to right
#		FL			Move focus area to left
#		FLON			Lengthen the focus area
#		FSHO			Shorten the focus area
#		ER			Erase backward by one character
#		NG			Display next group of choice
#		PG			Display previous group of choice
#		LX			Enter or exit associate state
#		DS			Display the selection region.
#		AS			Abort the selection region.
#		SC			Enter character display.
# A control key is indicated by an up-arrow key follows by a upper case letter.
# E.g. <control-K> is indicated by ^K.
# If a <special key name> is not bound for a CM, CM uses its default
# key binding.  If the binding of <special key name> is specified inside an
# <input mode>, this binding exists only for this <input mode>.
#
# Default
#
%%KLE_DEFAULT			# do not change this name unless new CM created.
				# for Korean, only following 'special key names'
				# are valid.
	# CM_ON only has one key, don't use Function keys here
	%CM_ON:		^@::"「한글」"			# Hangul ON
	# first one is always ctrl key and second one is always Function key
	%CM_OFF:	^@::"「영문」"			# Hangul OFF
	%HEX_MODE_ON_OFF: ^X:F12:"「코드」"		# hex input ON & OFF
	%AUTOMATA:
		PG=^P=<			# Display previous group of Hanja
		NG=^N=>			# Display next group of Hanja
		AS=^A			# Abort selection
		DS=^W			# Start Hanja selection
		NC=^N			# Start forward stepping Hanja choices
		PC=^P			# Start backward stepping Hanja choices
		SC=^J			# Display special character menu
                CM=^K                   # Commit preedit text
