Installation Instructions:
==========================
 
Installing and Uninstalling Adobe Reader 7.0 for Solaris 
 
To install Adobe Reader 7.0, follow these steps: 
 
- Tarball Installer:
	1. Make sure you have at least 140 MB of available disk space 
	2. Run "gunzip AdbeRdr70_solaris_enu.tar.gz" followed by "tar -xvf AdbeRdr70_solaris_enu.tar"
	3. Run the "INSTALL" script in the "AdobeReader" directory thus 
	created
 
	To uninstall Adobe Reader 7.0, simply delete the directory 
	where it was installed. 

Installation of the Browser plugin (not done by default):
- To install the browser plugin, you would need to execute the script
  "<INSTALL_PATH>/Browser/install_browser_plugin". Before doing so,
  please go through "<INSTALL_PATH>/Browser/Browser_Plugin_HowTo.txt" 
  for details.


Installation Issues

Adobe Reader requires libstdc++.so.5. Some systems might not have it
installed by default. To fix this, you need to install the 
compat-libstdc++ package.


Troubleshooting Issues:
=======================

PPKLite.api Failed to Load
PPKLite requires the OpenLDAP package to be installed on the system,
and fails to initialize in its absence. If you get this error when 
acroread starts up, you will need to install the LDAP libraries 
(OpenLDAP package).  If PPKLite still fails to load, make a link to the 
installed libldap.so.X and liblber.so.X in 
<INSTALL_PATH>/Reader/sparcsolaris/lib with the names 'libldap.so' and 
'liblber.so'. [1132741]

Mutt Does Not Launch
Selecting 'mutt' as the preferred email client requires the presence of
'xterm' in your PATH. If mutt fails to launch when you try to send an email
from the Adobe Reader, please make sure xterm exists in your PATH. [1184354]

Some System Fonts do not display in Document/Properties Window/Toolbar
Adobe Reader searches for system fonts in the directory list specified 
in the PSRESOURCEPATH environment variable, in addition to some 
predefined system directories.  If your system has several additional 
font directories which Adobe Reader may not be searching, you can add 
those directories to the PSRESOURCEPATH environment variable before 
launching Adobe Reader.  If the required fonts are not embedded in the
document, checking the Document > Use Local Fonts option, Adobe
Reader shall pick up the fonts from the system as specified by the
PSRESOURCEPATH variable.

CJK Text Display of bolded text when magnification is applied 
Some CJK bolded characters may be blurred if the original application 
created the bolded text with synthetic bolding. If the Smooth Text and 
Use CoolType preferences in the Page Display preference panel are turned 
off, when the document is magnified you may see some white areas or 
cracks. Acrobat 4.x writes a character four times to achieve bolding, 
and for some documents, such text may appear as four lines of text 
instead of appearing as bold text. In Acrobat 5.0, synthetic bolding is 
used. Adobe recommends turning on the Smooth Text and Use 
CoolType preferences in the Display preference panel to avoid seeing 
white areas or cracks when the bolded text is magnified. [418447]  
 
Find Dialog - Using Find to Locate Unicode Characters 
You can use Find to locate Unicode characters within a PDF 
document. To do this, add a "\u" in front of the Unicode character for 
which you want to search. For example, to search for the Unicode 
equivalent of the ASCII character "A" , enter "\u0041" in the Find 
dialog. For some CJK characters, such as Unicode "4e01", you can 
specify "\u4e01". [413632] 
  
Stretching/Skewing of Page Text on some systems
You may face some stretching/skewing effect on the page display on 
certain systems.  This problem can be resolved by going to Edit > 
Preference > Page Display tab, and setting the "Custom Resolution" to 
the currently displayed System setting. [1154513]

Search does not complete for socket files
If the specified search path contains a socket file (typical paths are 
/tmp or $HOME), the search will not complete.  Make sure that the 
specified path contains only regular files, and no socket files.
[1148788]

Sending Mail Using Mutt
If a terminal window flashes and disappears when the selected email 
client is mutt, adding the line "set autoedit=no" to $HOME/.muttrc
would enable sending mail using mutt. [1117619]

Evolution Crashes on Sending Mail
This happens with earlier versions of evolution. If evolution crashes on
sending mail (when Evolution is the selected Email client), try keeping
evolution running in the background. If it still crashes, please upgrade 
to evolution 2.0 or later.  You might need to keep it running in the
background. [1087494]

Accessibility is Not Active
The Adobe Reader checks the gconf registry to find if accessibility 
support is enabled on a system. If gconftool-2 is not available on a 
system, accessibility support is turned off in the Reader. If your 
system does not have gconftool-2 and you wish to use the accessibility 
features of Adobe Reader, change the line 'ACRO_AT_ACTIVE="false"' to 
'ACRO_AT_ACTIVE="true"' in the file <INSTALL_PATH>/bin/acroread, in the 
block 'if [ "$IS_GCONF_TOOL" = "no" ]' near the end of the file.
[1161246]

Enabling Document Accessibility
1. Turn on accessibility support on your system using gconf-editor or 
gconftool-2 to set the key /desktop/gnome/interface/accessibility to 
true.
2. Enable the keyboard selection cursor (F7 toggles the cursor. It can 
also be enabled through "Edit -> Preferences -> Accessibility -> Always 
display the keyboard selection cursor").
3. Check the option "Edit -> Preferences -> Reading -> Enable document 
accessibility".

Hong Kong Character Set and Comments and Bookmarks 
Acrobat Reader 5.0 supports the Hong Kong character set for text in a 
PDF file. It is an extension to the Adobe Chinese Traditional character 
set. If you would like to view PDF files that contain text using the 
Hong Kong character set, please install support for the Chinese 
Traditional character by installing the Chinese Traditional Language 
Pack. Since the Hong Kong character set is not part of the standard 
system fonts you will not be able to comment or create bookmarks using 
Hong Kong characters. [407877] 
   
Adobe Reader Needs Access to pwd 
Adobe Reader will not run correctly from a directory where the "pwd" 
command fails.

Removing Previous Preferences
We recommend you remove the file $HOME/.acrorc and the directory 
$HOME/.adobe (if they exist) before running Adobe Reader 7.0 for the 
first time.  This ensures the default preference settings are used when 
you first run Adobe Reader. This is not, however, a necessity, and may 
actually be undesirable if you wish to continue running older versions 
of Adobe Reader.

Recent Files Names 
Files listed in the File menu are "recent files" and depend upon exact 
path names. If you open a file in a session using automounter and the 
automounter goes down, attempting to open the "recent file" will give a 
"No such file or directory" error.  This also occurs when the file is 
moved, renamed, or Reader is run from a different machine that does 
not have the same file systems mounted.

Prevent Temporary Files from Showing Up in Recent File List 
To prevent temporary files (for instance opened from the Web) from 
appearing in the "recent files" list, set your mailcap entry as follows:
   
    application/pdf;acroread -tempFile %s

Writing the Preferences File 
Adobe Reader does not warn the user when the preferences file cannot be 
written.  Please make sure '$HOME/.adobe' is a writable directory if you 
wish to save preferences.

Window Managers 
We have tested with KDE and GNOME environments.

Printing Password-protected PDFs 
Users cannot print password-protected PDF documents to PostScript from 
the command line even though they are able to print the files from Adobe 
Reader.

Heterogenous File Server Environment 
When operating in a heterogenous network environment using Novell 
servers, we recommend you avoid giving PDF files long names (greater 
than 32 characters). A Novell® server displays the long file name to the 
user of a Macintosh® computer, but MacOS® prevents Adobe Reader from 
opening the file. This is not a problem on Windows.

Command line help 
At the command line, type 'acroread -help' or 'acroread -helpall' for 
more information on command line options. Note that when using these 
command lines you must still supply a DISPLAY variable if one is not 
already defined in your environment. 

Printing: no document printed and/or error in lp log 
When you lp foo.ps, it creates a symbolic link from the spool file to 
the foo.ps file.  This saves space on the file system.  Unfortunately, 
Adobe Reader creates a temporary file to spool, writes the PostScript 
out, and then deletes the temporary file before the lpd process can get 
hold of it.  The solution is to include the "-c" option (copy) on the lp 
or lpr command in the print dialog box.  This forces the lp process to 
copy the file to the spool area instead of making a link.

Adobe Reader Search 
If you want to create full text search indexes that can be reliably used 
across platforms, you must use ISO 9660 file naming conventions for 
the indexed files (8.3 uppercase, restricted character set).  If you 
don't use such names, the UNIX Reader will attempt to guess what the 
Unix filenames are. This causes delays in searching, and may result in 
the file not being found.

Select Tool and Snapshot Tool
The select tool can be used to select text in the document, and the 
snapshot tool can be used to select some area in the page, which is 
automatically copied to the clipboard.

Cannot Submit Forms From Web Browsers if multiple instances are running
Submitting forms on the web will not work if Netscape (or other Web 
Browser) has warned you that it found a lock file in the .Netscape  
folder. This warning (which occurs when you first launch Netscape) 
usually means you have another copy of Netscape running. You may fix 
this problem by insuring that only one copy of Netscape is running. If a 
lock file is left around because of a Netscape crash, you may simply 
delete the .Netscape/lock file.
