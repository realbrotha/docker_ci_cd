When Device Management is in the Rights Included column, it grants the right to allocate and deallocate devices (assign to one user at a time such devices as tape drives, disk drives, printers and other peripherals), and to correct error conditions related to those devices. 
<p>
If Device Management is grayed, then you are not entitled to Add or Remove this right.
