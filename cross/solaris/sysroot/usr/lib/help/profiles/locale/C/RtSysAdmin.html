The System Administrator right provides a comprehensive set of administrative rights. However, the rights exclude those that are security related. So, for example, the system administrator can add new user accounts but not change a user's password. Nor can the system administrator grant rights to another user.
<p>
If System Administrator is grayed, then you are not entitled to Add or Remove this right.
