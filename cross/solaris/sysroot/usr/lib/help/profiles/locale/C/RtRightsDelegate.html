When Rights Delegation is in the Rights Included column, it grants a user or role limited ability to assign users to roles, and to assign rights to roles, users, and other rights. 
<p>
This is limited in that a user or role granted Rights Delegation can only:
<ul>
<li>assign other users to those roles already assigned to the user itself
<li>assign to users, roles, and other rights only those rights that the user or role itself has been assigned</ul>
<p>
If Rights Delegation is grayed, then you are not entitled to Add or Remove this right.
