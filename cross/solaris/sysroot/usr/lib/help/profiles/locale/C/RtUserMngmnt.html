When User Management is in the Rights Included column, it grants the right to create and modify users. However it does not grant the ability to modify itself (as a security measure). Nor does it grant the right to modify users' passwords (see User Security).
<p>
If User Management is grayed, then you are not entitled to Add or Remove this right.
