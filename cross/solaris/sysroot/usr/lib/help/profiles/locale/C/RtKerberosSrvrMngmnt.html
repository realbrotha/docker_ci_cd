When Kerberos Server Management is in the Rights Included column, it grants 
the right to perform Kerberos administrative tasks such as creating/destroying 
the initial database and starting/stopping the administrative daemon processes.

The Kerberos Server Management profile also includes the rights granted by
the Kerberos Client Management profile.
<p>
If Kerberos Server Management is grayed, then you are not entitled to Add or Remove this right.
