When View OS Services, Patches, and Diskless Clients is in the Rights Included column, it grants the right to list OS services and patches using the <tt>smosservice</tt> command, and to list diskless clients using the <tt>smdiskless</tt> command. It does not grant rights to add, modify, or delete OS services, patches, or diskless clients.
<p>
If View OS Services, Patches, and Diskless Clients is grayed, then you are not entitled to Add or Remove this right.
