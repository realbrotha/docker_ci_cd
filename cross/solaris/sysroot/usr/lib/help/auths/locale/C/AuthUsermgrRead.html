When View Users and Roles is in the Authorizations Included column, it grants the authorization to list and read user and role accounts in the Users tools of the Solaris Management Console. It does not grant authorizations to add, modify, or delete these accounts (see Manage Users) nor does it grant the authorization to change user and role passwords (see Change Password).
<p>
If View Users and Roles is grayed, then you are not entitled to Add or Remove this authorization.
