When Get SNMP Information is in the Authorizations Included column, it grants the authorization to get SNMP device information (groups and tables) through the SNMP Provider for WBEM. It does not grant the authorization to set SNMP device information (see Set SNMP Information).
<p>
If Get SNMP Information is grayed, then you are not entitled to Add or Remove this authorization.
