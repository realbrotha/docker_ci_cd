When View Serial Ports is in the Authorizations Included column, it grants the authorization to list and view serial port information, in the Serial Ports tool of the Solaris Management Console. It does not authorize the modification of serial port settings (see Manage Serial Ports) or the deletion of serial ports (see Delete Serial Ports).
<p>
If View Serial Ports is grayed, then you are not entitled to Add or Remove this authorization.
