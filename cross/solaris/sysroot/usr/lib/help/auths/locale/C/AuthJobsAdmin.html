When Manage All Jobs is in the Authorizations Included column, it grants the authorization to add, modify, or delete any job of any user, and also grants the authorization to modify cron policies, in the Job Scheduler tool of the Solaris Management Console.
<p>
If Manage All Jobs is grayed, then you are not entitled to Add or Remove this authorization.
