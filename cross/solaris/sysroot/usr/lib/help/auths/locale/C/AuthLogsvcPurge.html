When Remove Log Files is in the Authorizations Included column, it grants the authorization to delete logged information, in the Log Viewer tool of the Solaris Management Console. It does not grant the authorization to change log service settings (see Manage Log Settings).
<p>
If Remove Log Files is grayed, then you are not entitled to Add or Remove this authorization.
