When Assign Owned Roles is in the Authorizations Included column, it grants the authorization to assign other users to those roles already assigned to the user itself, in the Users tools of the Solaris Management Console.

If Assign Owned Roles is grayed, then you are not entitled to Add or Remove this authorization.
