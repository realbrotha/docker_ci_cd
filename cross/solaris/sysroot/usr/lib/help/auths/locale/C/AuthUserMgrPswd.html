When Change Password is in the Authorizations Included Column, it grants the authorization to change user and role passwords, in the Users tools of the Solaris Management Console. It does not authorize the addition, modification, or deletion of user or role accounts (see Manage Users).
<p>
If Change Password is grayed, then you are not entitled to Add or Remove this authorization.
