When Delete Serial Ports is in the Authorizations Included column, it grants the authorization to delete serial ports, in the Serial Ports tool of the Solaris Management Console. It does not authorize the modification of serial port settings (see Manage Serial Ports).
<p>
If Delete Serial Ports is grayed, then you are not entitled to Add or Remove this authorization.
