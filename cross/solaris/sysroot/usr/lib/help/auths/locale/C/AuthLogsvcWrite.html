When Manage Log Settings is in the Authorizations Included column, it grants the authorization to change log service settings, in the Log Viewer tool of the Solaris Management Console. It does not grant the authorization to delete log information (see Remove Log Files).
<p>
If Manage Log Settings is grayed, then you are not entitled to Add or Remove this authorization.
