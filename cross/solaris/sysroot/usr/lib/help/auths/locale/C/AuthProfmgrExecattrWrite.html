<p>
When Manage Commands is in the Authorizations Included Column, it grants the authorization to add a command to a right, or to remove it from a right, in the Users tools of the Solaris Management Console. It also grants the authority to change the execution attributes of commands included in a right: change real and effective UIDs and GIDs.
<p>
If Manage Commands is grayed, then you are not entitled to Add or Remove this authorization.
