When Manage Users is in the Authorizations Included column, it grants the authorization to add, modify, and delete user accounts and user templates in the Users tools of the Solaris Management Console. It does not grant the authorization to change user and role passwords (see Change Password).
<p>
If Manage Users is grayed, then you are not entitled to Add or Remove this authorization.
