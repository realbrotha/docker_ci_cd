When Manage OS Services and Patches is in the Rights Included column, it grants the right to add and delete OS services, and to add, remove, and syncronize patches using the <tt>smosservice</tt> command. 
<p>
If Manage OS Services and Patches is grayed, then you are not entitled to Add or Remove this right.
