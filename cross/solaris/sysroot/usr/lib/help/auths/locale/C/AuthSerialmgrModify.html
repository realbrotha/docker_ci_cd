When Manage Serial Ports is in the Authorizations Included column, it grants the authorization to modify serial port settings, in the Serial Ports tool of the Solaris Management Console. It does not authorize deletion of serial ports (see Delete Serial Ports).
<p>
If Manage Serial Ports is grayed, then you are not entitled to Add or Remove this authorization.
