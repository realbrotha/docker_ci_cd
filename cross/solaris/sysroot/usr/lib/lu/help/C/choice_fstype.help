\f2Help on FS Type Choices.\f1

By default, the \f2FS Type\f1 in the New BE will be the same as the 
corresponding directory in the Active BE. If you would like to change 
the file system type, move the cursor using UP and DOWN arrow keys
and select a desired file system by Pressing ENTER (Carriage Return). 

You can escape to the main menu with out selecting a fs type using the
\f4Abort\f1 key.
