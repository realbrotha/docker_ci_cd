  What's New in 10.0.6.1358

   This build includes many fixes and
   incremental improvements over the
   earlier releases. A lot of the work in
   this build also has gone towards
   stabilizing features and fixing many
   known issues and bugs.

  Security Issues Fixed in This Release

     * Incorrect RIFF/DATA chunk size headers causes 
       player to crash
     * Long String in SMIL Parameter "system-screen-size" 
       Causes Buffer Overflow

  Other Issues Fixed in This Release

     * audio/PCMU component missing
       https://bugs.helixcommunity.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3506
       Helix Player now has support for U-Law and
       A-Law AU audio files.
     * wvffplin.cpp requires SimplePayloadFormat
       https://bugs.helixcommunity.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2440
       Previously Helix Player was unable to play back
       uncompressed audio because a portion of this code
       was contained in a non-GPL library.  This code has
       been moved so that WAV and PCM files now work.
     * Chained Ogg support has been added.
     * Some memory leaks have been fixed.
     * Core dump when given illegal options after "-e"  
       or "-c" has been fixed.
     * One known Xerror on Sparc has been fixed.
     * The output of -h option has been changed from   
       'hxplayer' to 'realplay'

  Known Issues

     * If you are having problems playing
       back media and are behind a proxy
       you can try using rtsp transport via
       http only (go to transports pane in
       prefs, select "use specified
       transport" and click "configure
       rtsp." Then uncheck "attempt
       multicast," "attempt udp," and
       "attempt tcp.")
     * Context Menu might not work while
       managing favorites with older GTK
       versions.
     * If RealPlayer 8 is installed on the
       system (via rpm) the RealPlayer 10
       rpm does not remove RP8 before
       installing RP10. This means that RP8
       and RP10 coexist on the same system.
       In the event that this configuration
       results in any problems with the
       embedded player (plugin) please
       delete the file rpnp.so from your
       mozilla plugins directory. (issue
       #2678)
     * Some content encoded in RealAudio 3
       fails to play. Multimedia content
       that uses RA3 as the audio codec
       will still play without audio. RA3
       has been deprecated.
     * Player does not play gnome-vfs URI's
       (smb://). Workaround is to mount the
       samba share using smbmount etc
       (issue #2269).
     * Alsa and esound drivers are not
       included in this build
       The OSS device used for playback can
       be set using the AUDIO environment
       variable. eg export AUDIO=/dev/dsp2
     * See the Helix Player bug tracker for
       a list of the latest issues that
       affect the player.
     * The value of the UDPPort preference,
       if used, needs to be set as a range,
       for example:

        UseUDPPort=1
        UDPPort=7000-7010

       Setting it to a single number
       will result in a player crash.
     * Multiple instances of Real Player 
       result in a hang of second instance
       when you start up Realplayer from menu 
       or from command line. 
       You can use "-n" option to start up 
       multiple Players.
     * If you click "General", "FAQ", etc. under 
       help menu you probably get error "Couldn't
       display...", and then the file browser is
       launched.
       To solve this problem you can specify the 
       location of web browser in Realplayer 
       preference->General, Realplayer will launch
       web browser instead of file browser and go
       to the specified document on internet if you
       already set the proxy.  
     * Garble messages displayed when executing 
       realplay ?-help in gnome-terminal with
       zh_CN/zh_TW/ja locale.
       To solve this problem, use UTF-8 locale
       instead in gnome-terminal.  
     * Realplayer for Solaris has been given the L10N waiver 
       for Swedish.
