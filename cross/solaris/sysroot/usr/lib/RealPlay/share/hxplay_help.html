<h2><a name="Nightly_builds"></a>Downloading nightly builds</h2>
<p>Nightly builds of the Helix Player are available for testing.&nbsp;
There's a good chance that no one other than
yourself has ever tried executing the exact binary you are downloading,
and thus, we can't guarantee what these builds will or won't do.&nbsp;
They may crash, catch fire, delete every file on your machine and all
machines in a five mile radius, or simply do nothing.&nbsp; <b>Therefore,
use
at your own risk!</b></p>
<p>Nevertheless, these builds may have features and bugfixes not yet
present in our current milestone release.&nbsp; We really appreciate
any effort made to work with these releases, as it helps <a
 href="https://player.helixcommunity.org/qa">our testing effort</a> out
greatly.<br>
</p>
<p>Steps to use:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="http://forms.helixcommunity.org/helixdnaclient/">Visit
the nightly build page</a><br>
  </li>
  <li>Scroll down and locate the latest date listed (dates listed in
reverse order)</li>
  <li>In the "HelixPlayer" column, find the build that is right for
you.&nbsp; Follow the link.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Agree to the license(s), then download the build</li>
  <li>Untar the tarball, and follow the included instructions</li>
</ol>
