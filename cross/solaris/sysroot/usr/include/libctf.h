 * This header file defines the interfaces available from the CTF debugger
 * library, libctf.  This library provides functions that a debugger can
 * use to operate on data in the Compact ANSI-C Type Format (CTF).  This
 * is NOT a public interface, although it may eventually become one in
 * the fullness of time after we gain more experience with the interfaces.
 *
 * In the meantime, be aware that any program linked with libctf in this
 * release of Solaris is almost guaranteed to break in the next release.
 *
 * In short, do not user this header file or libctf for any purpose.
